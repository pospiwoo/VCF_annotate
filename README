VCF_ann.py is a script that parses information from VCF file and annotate each entry with 
useful information. After running the script, the output VCF file will contain annotation
information appended at the end of each line. (tab delemited)
Appended information is as follows.

1. Type of variation (sub indel, silent, intergenic, etc) when multiple, annotate with the most deleterious possibility. 
  - According to the following VCF specifications, when multiple types are
    present, the script assums that they are ordered according to ‘most deleterious’. 
    (and thus, using the left-most annotation)

  - Multiple “effects / consequences” are separated by comma.
    * Optional: Annotations are sorted by  sorted by:
      i. Effect/Consequence: Estimated deleteriousness. Compare using 
         ‘most deleterious’ when multiple consequences are predicted.

2. Depth of sequence coverage at the site
3. Number of reads supporting the variant
4. percentage of reads supoorting the var vs those supporting the reference reads
  - This is calculated as, 
    <#_of_variant_reads> / <total_read_depth>, and 
    <#_of_reference_reads> / <total_read_depth>
    
5. allele freq of variant from BI ExAC
6. additional optional informaion from ExAC
  - while there exists a lot of information returned from ExAC, the script adds
    full retured http string result from ExAC so that any relavent information 
    can be parsed afterwards when needed
